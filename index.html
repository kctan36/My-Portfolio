        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>My name is Kyle Tan. A living diety and God's greatest regret.</p>
        <p>I have started learning programming at mid-September of 2020.
          Slowly progressing through my course, I have learnt bitf each main parts of web development: HTML, CSS and JS. 
          Now, I am able to create static websites with little to no scripts, minimal interactivity and somewhat responsive. 
          </p>
        <p>As much as other people love me, there is no one else that I love more than... me. I also enjoy playing games, the piano and girls. 
          I spend most of my time working and my free time also working. But even with that hindrance, I still manage to keep my hobby of killing children and hiding their bodies under their matresses for their parents to find. I also ice-skate.</p>

            <p>I made this page as a project from Codeacademy "Full Stack Engineer" Career Path. 
              This page just contains minimal CSS and was made to refer back to since I initially struggled with understanding all the CSS selectors that I can utilise.</p>

            <p>This page, much like the other's in here are projects from Codeacademy. 
              This page was born out of my passion for Ice Skating. 
              I took inspirations from other projects I have completed for Codeacademy so far. The "Join Us" part of the website inisde the hero of the website was from the "Fotomatic" website we were asked to fix in the course. <a href="https://kctan36.github.io/Ice-Skating-Club/">Visit Site.</a></p>

            <p>This is the current page that you're looking at. This page doesn't have a lot of special looking features, but the bread and butter of this website is its responsiveness.
              This page has the best responsiveness out of all the pages I've made so far.
              With multiple media queries to appropriately adjust the CSS for all the breakpoints. <a href="https://kctan36.github.io/My-Portfolio/">Visit Site.</a>

            <p>Unlike all the other pages in this list, this project was not for Codeacademy. 
              This project was just to help me explore CSS with a bit more freedom which helped me feel more comfotable using the language.
              It helped me develop a deeper understanding and learn parts of CSS that wasn't covvered in the course so far. <a href="https://kctan36.github.io/Vet-Website/">Visit Site.</a>

            <p>Although this page was a part of a Codeacademy project, I did not put much effort into making it.
              However, it did still help me get a better grasp of the uses and how to manipulate flexbox to make my website more responsive and help me position my content where I want them.
