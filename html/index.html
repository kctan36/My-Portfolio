        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>My name is Kyle Tan. A living diety and God's greatest regret.</p>
        <p>I have started learning programming at mid-September of 2020.
          Slowly progressing through my course, I have learnt bitf each main parts of web development: HTML, CSS and JS. 
          Now, I am able to create static websites with little to no scripts, minimal interactivity and somewhat responsive. 
          </p>
        <p>As much as other people love me, there is no one else that I love more than... me. I also enjoy playing games, the piano and girls. 
          I spend most of my time working and my free time also working. But even with that hindrance, I still manage to keep my hobby of killing children and hiding their bodies under their matresses for their parents to find. I also ice-skate.</p>
